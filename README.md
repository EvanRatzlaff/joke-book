# README

This is my first rails project submission for Flatiron 
 
 Still getting the hang of what to write here.

 My project idea was to create an application that is geared towards comedians.
 I wanted to create something for them to be able to store their jokes, and the rooms they have told them in.
 The users who would be on this site would be able to see other comedians jokes in the rooms they have told them in. 
 Users(comedians) can also like other comedians jokes if they want. 
 What I used to create this project

* Ruby version 5

* System dependencies (not sure)

* Visual Studio Code

* There are no test suites included with this project.
