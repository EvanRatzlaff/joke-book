# README

This is one of my first Rails projects that I created while attending Flatiron School.

 My initial project idea was to create an application that is geared towards helping new stand-up comedians.
 I wanted to create something for them to be able to store their jokes, along with the rooms in which they have told those jokes.
 Any user who accesses this site would be able to see other comedians jokes in the rooms they have told them in as well. 
 Users(comedians) can also "like" other comedians jokes if they choose. 
 What I used to create this project

* Ruby version 5

* System dependencies (not sure)

* Visual Studio Code

* There are no test suites included with this project.
